# Mock API Generator

This is a simple tool to quickly generate mock APIs for development and testing purposes. It helps you simulate a backend without the need for a real server during the development process.

## Features

- Easily create mock API endpoints.
- Customize mock responses to suit your needs.
- Quick setup and lightweight.
- Great for testing frontend applications without a real backend.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Husniddin-web/mock-api.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd mock-api
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. **Start the mock API server:**

    After installing the dependencies, you can start the server by running:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. **Access the mock API:**

    The mock API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. You can now test the predefined mock endpoints.

3. **Customize mock data:**

    You can customize the mock data by modifying the configuration file in the project. The mock API endpoints are already defined, and you can add or change them as needed.

## Available Endpoints

By default, the following endpoints are available:

- **GET /api/users**: Returns a list of users.
- **GET /api/products**: Returns a list of products.

Feel free to add more endpoints or modify the existing ones by adjusting the configuration.
